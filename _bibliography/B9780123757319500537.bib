abstract = {ABSTRACT
Attention modulates neuronal responses throughout the visual cortex of primates. For direction-selective neurons in cortical area MT, this modulation is multiplicative; that is, it changes a neuron's response to all motion directions by the same factor without affecting the neuron's selectivity. The intensity of the modulation and whether it results in an increase or decrease of cells’ responses are determined by the attended stimulus location (spatial attention) and the attended stimulus feature (feature-based attention). Rather than representing distinct attentional effects, spatial and feature-based attention can be unified in a “feature similarity gain model” in which attended locations and features interact with a cell's selectivity to determine the attentional modulation of information processing in the cortex. Attention modulates the responses of neurons in the visual cortex of primates (Moran and Desimone, 1985). We studied such attentional modulation in the middle temporal area (MT) of nonhuman primates in which a large proportion of cells are direction-selective; that is, they respond strongly to only a subset of directions of visual motion. Direction-selective neurons in area MT play a central role in visual motion perception (Newsome et al., 1985) and have been linked directly to psychophysical performance in motion tasks (Britten et al., 1996). Their most characteristic feature, their direction tuning curves (i.e., the bell-shaped response profile as a function of stimulus direction), correlates well with psychophysical thresholds of motion perception (Snowden et al., 1992).}
