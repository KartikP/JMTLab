The JMT Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab is led by Julio Martinez-Trujillo, MD PhD, and is part of the Robarts Research Institute in Western University. The laboratory has multiple research interests:

1. **Neurophysiological bases of attention**

    Attention can be defined as the selective filtering and modulation of information processing in the brain. It plays a major role in human performance. Currently, we know that visual signals entering the different cortical areas are amplified when we are paying attention to them and attenuated when we ignore them. How the brain accomplishes this modulation of sensory information processing remains unclear. [insert what the lab does here]

2. **Neural mechanism of working memory**

    Working memory can be defined as the short-term maintenance and manipulation of information that is no longer available to the senses. Working memory is thought to arise from the activity of networks of interconnected neurons that produce sustained firing patterns that encode the contents of working memory in the absence of sensory inputs.

3. **Pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders**

    Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, accompanied by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, that become evident during early development. [insert what the lab does here]

4. **Cell types of the primate neocortex**

    The brain contains a variety of neuronal types. Over the last decade it has become clear that neuronal types vary among different species. We use tools such as patch clamp and anatomical reconstruction of neurons in slices of neocortical tissue to characterize the morphology and function of neurons. By building a database of neurons, we aim to produce biophysical circuit models of different brain regions.
